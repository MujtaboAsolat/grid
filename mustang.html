                    Classic Recreations of Yukon, Oklahoma has been building a variety of officially-licensed
                    continuation Mustang Shelby models for the past decade, and has now secured the rights to do the
                    same for the 1969-1970 Mach 1, Boss 302 and Boss 429.

                429 will have a 460 cubic-inch V8 with “Boss 9” hemispherical heads and electronic fuel injection that’s
                already putting out 700 hp, and they’re not done tuning it yet.

                hits 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, and includes an optional magnetic suspension for less than $45,000. It will
                be comfortable and refined enough to take on a road trip, while still keeping up with the pricier BMW M4
                on the track.</p>

            <p class="but">But no matter how good the current car is, there's always going to be a certain group of
                people who wish Ford would simply keep building vintage Mustangs. That's where continuation builders
                such as Classic Recreations come in.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="Class">Classic Recreations has been building officially licensed Shelby Mustangs for a while, and
                according to
                our friends at AUTOMOBILE, they're good. Really good. Recently, CR landed the license to build three
                more classic Mustangs: the 1969-1970 Boss 302, the 1969-1970 Boss 429, and the 1969-1970 Mach 1. These
                aren't resto-mods, either. Underneath the vintage sheetmetal, you essentially get a brand new car.

                Ford
                Nationals in 2017, it got our attention because it was straight as an arrow and with paint as deep as
                the

                    Then we looked under the hood; “Nice, 
                    four-cam Cobra motor swap and it looks 
                    factory.” As we soon found out, it was. So 
                    What?

                    That engine wasn’t even a dream in any 
                    engineers’ eyes in 1969. The deeper we 
                    looked, the more it became obvious what 
                    we were looking at. Jim very skillfully 
                    mated the 1969 body to the complete 
                    chassis and running gear of a 2014 Shelby 
                    GT500, complete with the full 2014 
                    interior, accessories, and even fuel filler. 
                    And a few bug guts in the grille proved he 
                    drove it to Carlisle from his home in 
                    Parkersburg, West Virginia. </pre>
